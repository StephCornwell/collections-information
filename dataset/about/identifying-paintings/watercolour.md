## Tips on how to recognise

* Look at the surface of the painting. Brush strokes are less clear in watercolours and the painting should have very little to no visible texture.   
* The colour of the paper underneath may affect the colour or be clear due to its translucent properties. This can give the illusion of luminosity to the painting too.  
* Look at the design of the painting. Often watercolour are used in conjunction with other techniques, particularly prints that are then coloured using watercolour.
