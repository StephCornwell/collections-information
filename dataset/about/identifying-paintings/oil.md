## Tips on how to recognise

*  If known, consider when and where the painting was made. For instance, a Flemish painting, made between 15th CE and 18th CE, it’s likely to be an oil painting.
* Look for raised brush strokes on the surface of the picture. The surface texture should be clearly visible to the naked eye, and these raised areas or undulations should correspond exactly to the colours they lie over. If possible, hold the canvas flat and take a good look along the surface
* Look for a coat of varnish, usually applied to finished oil paintings as protection and to bring out the colour of the paint. Is the image glossy? If so, it is likely to be an oil painting, as acrylic paint tends to dry more matte.
* Check the colours and its clarity and the edges. Oil paint's long drying time and tendency to blend give it softer edges.
* Keep an eye out for ‘craquelure’. Old oil paintings will show a fine pattern of spiderweb-like cracks \(watch out for artificially aged paintings!\).

### Dating 

The origins of oil painting, date to at least the 7th century CE in Bamiyan, Afghanistan. In Europe, oil as a painting medium is recorded only as early as the 11th century. The practice of easel painting with oil colours, stems directly from 15th-century tempera-painting techniques.

### Support

The standard support for oil paintings is a canvas made of linen stretched over a wooden frame. Oil paintings on wooden panels were also common during both the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Canvas took over from panel in Italy only during the first half of the 16th century \(change led by Mantegna and the artists of Venice\). In the Netherlands this change took about a century longer, and panel paintings remained common, especially in Northern Europe.
