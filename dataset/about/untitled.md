## Tips on how to recognise

In 'How to Identify Prints A complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to injket' by Bamber Gascoigne, he notes that if you have no idea as what your print may be to ask yourself questions, and by a process of yes/no answers they will lead to the appropriate section of his book. Even, without this reference, approaching a print in this way can rule out what technique it is not.  Another useful resource is 'Prints and Printmaking An introduction to the history and techniques' by Anthony Griffiths, which has a section on abbreviations and lettering regarding technical terms which may be a support to the cataloguer.

* Look at the image. Compared with intaglio processes, relief printing allows for much larger areas of black space. 
* Look for a plate-mark. If there isn't one, its more likely to be a relief print than an intaglio. However, plate-marks can be added artificially or cut off. 

### Other Print Collections

### Dating 

Relief printing includes one of the oldest forms of printing, the woodcut, dating from c.800 AD in China as well as later evolution of the form in wood engraving  credited to Thomas Bewick in 1768.

### Support

Typically printed on a paper, vellum or parchment support

### Intaglio Prints

Other print collections can also be a useful tool in helping to identify prints in terms of their technique but also with title descriptions and subjects. Many prints that are in the Wellcome Collection have been found to also be represented in the British Museums Prints and Drawings Collections, some of whose prints have lettering, where items in our collection do not.
