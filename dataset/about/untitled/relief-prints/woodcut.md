# Woodcut

## Tips on how to recognise

* Look at the surface of the print. In woodcuts, the grain of the wood is visible in the image.

* Look at the design of the print. Due to the difficulty of cutting along the grain of the wood, fine detail was very difficult to achieve so designs tend to be simplified.

* Look at the colour of the print. If printed in black and white, larger areas of white may appear to have been scooped out. If in colour, a few colours may have been reused across the image layered on top of one another.
