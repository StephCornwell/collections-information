# Considerations before Cataloguing

##  Single or multiple records? 

Establish what you are creating a record for. Is it a single object or a group? This will influence the information included in the record and/or how it is recorded. 

If there are multiple images on a single sheet, consider if there is a need to create separate records for each image. For example, there may be an image on both sides of a sheet, a record can be created for each image, with both linked to a record describing the sheet as a whole facilitating retrieval.  

_Question: Unique ID numbers & multiple images -& questions around levels of hierarchy. i number scenarios:  
single image_

_Part numbered if identical_

  
_multiple images on one side of a single sheet_ 

_Different impressions / p\[l;ate marks on same sheet - 2 Ids  
Images collected on one sheet - 1 ID_

  
_multiple images on both sides of a single sheet  
group of images each on separate sheets - guidelines on when to treat as a group_

Is the work a unique item, such as a painting, or one created as a multiple edition, like prints and posters? 

## Sensitivity checking & personal data 

Consider the context in which the item was produced, and any personal data to be included in the bibliographic record - was the item produced in a context that would warrant sensitivity considerations, such as a therapy session? Consult [Access to personal data within our research collections](http://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/access-to-personal-data.pdf) to identify material that should be considered for restricted access or personal data that should not be made public.

## Language 

When including any information as free text ie. not controlled terminology, think about the language being used and how the information is framed. The [APA bias-free language guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) is helpful to think about this process.
