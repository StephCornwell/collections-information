# Considerations before Cataloguing

## What is being catalogued? 

Establish what you are creating a record for. Is it a single object or a group of objects? This will influence the information included in the record\(s\) and how it is recorded. 

This decision will also determine the allocation of unique ID numbers, and whether a part number is required. 

### Single or multiple records?

#### Single object

* A single object should be given a unique ID number, e.g. 39222i 
* Identical copies of an object should be given part numbers, e.g. 39222i.1, 39222i.2 The copies must be identical impressions. Prints must be printed from the same unaltered plate, with no differences in the inscription. These are considered to be the same state. If there are differences the copies must be treated as individual items and given a unique ID number. 

**Multiple images on a single sheet**

* Two or more images printed from the same plate \(with a single platemark\) = 1 object, allocate a single ID number. Describe both images in the same record. 
* Two or more images printed from different plates \(more than one platemark\) = 2 or more objects, allocate a unique ID to each image. Each image will have it's own record. Ensure the relationship between the images/records is clear in the catalogue. 
* Two or more images pasted onto or sharing a single sheet = 1 object, with 1 ID number. In the record briefly describe the images \(using cataloguers discretion to decide required specificity\) and ensure the nature and relationship of the images is clear in the record. _Sara's notes suggest an ID no for each image - check Inventory_ 
* Two or more images on both sides of a single sheet 
* Two or more images sharing a single mount or frame

Is the work a unique item, such as a painting, or one created as a multiple edition, like prints and posters? 

## Sensitivity checking & personal data 

Consider the context in which the item was produced, and any personal data to be included in the bibliographic record - was the item produced in a context that would warrant sensitivity considerations, such as a therapy session? Consult [Access to personal data within our research collections](http://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/access-to-personal-data.pdf) to identify material that should be considered for restricted access or personal data that should not be made public.

## Language 

When including any information as free text ie. not controlled terminology, think about the language being used and how the information is framed. The [APA bias-free language guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) is helpful to think about this process.
