# Considerations before Cataloguing

##  Single or multiple records? 

Establish what you are creating a record for. Is it a single object or a group? This will influence the information included in the record and/or how it is recorded. 

If there are multiple images on a single sheet, consider if there is a need to create separate records for each image. For example, there may be an image on both sides of a sheet, a record can be created for each image, with both linked to a record describing the sheet as a whole facilitating retrieval.  

###  __Single image

A single object should be given a unique ID number, e.g. 39222i

Identical copies of an object should be given part numbers, e.g. 39222i.1, 39222i.2  
The copies must be identical impressions. Prints must be printed from the same unaltered plate, with no differences in the inscription. These are considered to be the same state. If there are _any_ differences the copies must be treated as individual items and given a unique ID number. 

_What about objects cast from the same mold - part numbers?_

### Multiple images

  
multiple images on one side of a single sheet 

Different impressions / p\[l;ate marks on same sheet - 2 Ids  
Images collected on one sheet - 1 ID

  
multiple images on both sides of a single sheet  
group of images each on separate sheets - guidelines on when to treat as a group

Is the work a unique item, such as a painting, or one created as a multiple edition, like prints and posters? 

## Sensitivity checking & personal data 

Consider the context in which the item was produced, and any personal data to be included in the bibliographic record - was the item produced in a context that would warrant sensitivity considerations, such as a therapy session? Consult [Access to personal data within our research collections](http://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/access-to-personal-data.pdf) to identify material that should be considered for restricted access or personal data that should not be made public.

## Language 

When including any information as free text ie. not controlled terminology, think about the language being used and how the information is framed. The [APA bias-free language guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) is helpful to think about this process.
