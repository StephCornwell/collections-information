# Considerations before Cataloguing

## What is being catalogued: single or multiple records?

Establish what you are creating a record for. Is it a single object or a group of objects? This will influence the information included in the record\(s\) and how it is recorded. 

This decision will also determine the allocation of unique ID numbers, and whether a part number is required. 

### Single object

* A single object should be given a unique ID number, e.g. 39222i 
* Identical copies of an object should be given part numbers, e.g. 39222i.1, 39222i.2 The copies must be identical impressions. Prints must be printed from the same unaltered plate, with no differences in the inscription. These are considered to be the same state. If there are differences the copies must be treated as individual items and given a unique ID number. 

### **Multiple images on a single sheet**

In each instance ensure there is only **one** item record that can be ordered for a single sheet. 

* Two or more images printed from the same plate \(with a single platemark\) = 1 object, allocate a single ID number. Describe both images in the same record. 
* Two or more images printed from different plates \(more than one platemark\) = 2 or more objects, allocate a unique ID to each image. Each image will have it's own record. Ensure the relationship between the images/records is clear in the catalogue. 
* Two or more images pasted onto or sharing a single sheet = 1 object, with 1 ID number. In the record briefly describe the images \(using cataloguers discretion to decide required specificity\) and ensure the nature and relationship of the images is clear in the record.  
* Two or more images on both sides of a single sheet. 
  * The preferred option is to catalogue as 1 object, describe both images in one record, ensuring the description clearly states the relationship of the images. Allocate a single ID number.
  * For unique images \(drawings, paintings\) where it is felt the objects warrant their own record and description, catalogue as 2 or more objects. Ensure the relationship between the images/records is clear in the catalogue. Allocate an ID number with part numbers. 
* Two or more images sharing a single mount or frame. In this situation consider how and when the images were framed or mounted together.  
  * Mounted or framed by the artist or as part of an original collection. Retain the grouping, and:  \* The preferred option is to catalogue as 1 object. Describe all the images in one record, ensuring the description clearly states the relationship of the images. Allocate a single ID number. \* Where it is felt the objects warrant their own record and description, catalogue as 2 or more objects. Ensure the relationship between the images/records is clear in the catalogue. Allocate an ID number with part numbers. 
  * Where the mount or framing has occurred subsequently, and is not intrinsic to the original object or collection, treat as a Group of Objects \(see below\). The objects could be separated in the future for exhibition purposes, the catalogue records must account for this potential occurrence. 

### Group of Objects

The level of cataloguing granularity required will vary between objects. The cataloguer must   
group of images each on separate sheets - guidelines on when to treat as a group

Is the work a unique item, such as a painting, or one created as a multiple edition, like prints and posters? 

## Sensitivity checking & personal data 

Consider the context in which the item was produced, and any personal data to be included in the bibliographic record - was the item produced in a context that would warrant sensitivity considerations, such as a therapy session? Consult [Access to personal data within our research collections](http://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/access-to-personal-data.pdf) to identify material that should be considered for restricted access or personal data that should not be made public.

## Language 

When including any information as free text ie. not controlled terminology, think about the language being used and how the information is framed. The [APA bias-free language guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) is helpful to think about this process.
