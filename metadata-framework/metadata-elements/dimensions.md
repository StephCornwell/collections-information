# Dimensions

## _Required_

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Individual objects" %}
## Which dimensions should be recorded

* 2D object: record height x width
* 3D object: record height x width x depth
* Circular object: record diameter

At minimum the largest dimensions of the object should be recorded but enhanced records may also include measurements of more specific elements such as plate mark.  

## Unit of measurement

Record dimensions in metric units, rounded up to the nearest mm

## Areas of Measurement

Specify what is being measured using the following standard terms: 

* Sheet 
* Plate Mark
* Mount 
* Frame 
* Folded 
* Rolled
* Object \[3D objects only\]

{% hint style="info" %}
Plate mark 20 x 30 cm, sheet 30 x 40 cm
{% endhint %}

If the shape is unusual or a distinguishing characteristic also record an indication of the outline form. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Frame 45 x 20.5 cm \(oval\)
{% endhint %}

If the object is irregularly shaped record the greatest dimensions

If the object contains multiple distinct images, record an indication of the section.

{% hint style="info" %}
Overall 183 x 187 cm; Central panel 183 x 105 cm; Each side panel 183 x 39 cm
{% endhint %}

For multiple-part objects, record the number and dimensions of the components.

{% hint style="info" %}
4 panels 60 x 110 cm; Each panel 23 x 45 cm
{% endhint %}

## Layout

Element of object being recorded is stated first followed by dimension then shape characteristic if relevant to interpretation of dimension. 

Specify the dimension type and value in lowercase with spaces between. 

Order dimensions according to natural orientation

 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of objects" %}
vii. Groups of objects For a group of objects, describe the range of sizes using the smallest single work and largest single work as the range. e.g. range in size from 24 x 52 cm to 34 x 60 cm \(height x width\)



## Which dimensions should be recorded

* 2D object: record height x width
* 3D object: record height x width x depth
* Circular object: record diameter

The dimensions of the smallest and largest object in the group should be recorded 

## Unit of measurement

Record dimensions in metric units, rounded up to the nearest mm

## Areas of Measurement

Specify what is being measured using the following standard terms: 

* Sheet 
* Object \[3D objects only\]

## Layout

Element of object being recorded is stated first followed by dimensions in a range with the smallest object recorded before the largest

{% hint style="info" %}
range in size from 24 x 52 cm to 34 x 60 cm
{% endhint %}

Specify the dimension type and value in lowercase with spaces between. 

Order dimensions according to natural orientation

Record in a range with the smallest object recorded before the largest
