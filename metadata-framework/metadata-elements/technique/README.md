# Technique, Medium and Materials

## Definition

These elements specify the media and/or materials used to create the object, and where appropriate the processes or techniques used to apply it.

Technique refers to the process

{% hint style="info" %}
* 'drawing' in ‘chalk drawing’ 
* ‘painting’ in ‘acrylic painting’
{% endhint %}

Medium refers to a material applied to a support, typically for 2D objects

{% hint style="info" %}
* 'chalk' in ‘chalk drawing’ 
* ‘acrylic’ in ‘acrylic painting’
{% endhint %}

Materials refers to a material used to form the object, typically for 3D objects

{% hint style="info" %}
'paper' in 'cut-paper work'

'wax' in 'waxwork' 
{% endhint %}

## Terminology

To ensure consistency, terms for technique, medium and materials must be taken from the [Getty AAT](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/). 

Short lists for easy use are available below this entry in the sidebar.  

{% hint style="info" %}
For ease of use, the term 'Technique list' has been used to describe any terms that contain a technique. However, they may also contain the medium or material. Where these kinds of mixed terms are used, there is no need to repeat the medium or material terms individually. 
{% endhint %}

## Identification

To help with identifying techniques, mediums and materials, please see the [Identification section](../../../dataset/about/specifics.md). 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Individual objects" %}
## Layout

Each term should be expressed in a singular, non-abbreviated form.

Often the medium and technique are provided in the same standardised term. If they are not, or multiple terms apply, the element may be repeated.  

If there is uncertainty on the specific technique or medium, use the broadest applicable known term.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Groups of objects" %}
Terms should be chosen to describe each object in the group. If this would result in too many different techniques, mediums and/or material terms, choose the most prominent or broadest.

{% tab title="Born digital " %}
Unless a digital photograph, all born digital visual material should be given the broader term, digital images.
