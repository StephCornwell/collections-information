# Creator Name

## Definition

The Creator element should capture the name\(s\) of those responsible for the design and making of an object, and their role in that process. The metadata should record all identified creators.

Creators can be individuals, groups of individuals, corporate bodies or other entities involved in the creation of an object.

#### i. Identifying creators

The names of creators should be taken from the object itself or accompanying documentation from acquisition, previous cataloguing or provenance records. Where the creator name is taken from another source ensure that information is noted in the record and include a reference to the source.

#### ii. Unknown creators

Where a creator is not known the creator element can be omitted. If the geographical origin is known this can be used in the description to provide background to an unknown creator, e.g. Italian

#### iii. Ambiguous creators

If attribution is uncertain or ambiguous record this information in the record. 

e.g. attributed to Raphael 

If opinion on attribution is divided, then record this information in the record and index all the names in question. 

e.g.

#### iv. Name

The format and spelling for creator names should be taken from an authority list to ensure consistency. Check for an entry in the Wellcome Collection catalogue and use this if present. If the name is new to the Wellcome catalogue, check: LC Library of Congress authorities, ULAN Getty Union List of Artists Names, or other reliable sources. If there is more than one version of the name in use, select the most commonly used.

For personal names the name should be structured as follows: Surname, First name\(s\), dates of existence, role in relation to the object \(optional\). e.g. Lichtenstein, Roy, 1923-1997, painter

For corporate names check if there is an entry in the Wellcome catalogue, or LC or ULAN authority lists, as corporate names vary over time. If no authority can be found, take the name as it is written on the object or accompanying documentation.

#### v. Dates

For personal names include dates if known. Where the birth and death dates are not known, include the full range of dates for the artworks you are aware of, as an approximate active date. e.g. Bell, Stuart, active 1966-68

#### vi. Role of creator

In addition to the creator name record the relationship of that person/entity to the object, i.e. their role in its creation. To ensure consistency, role terminology should be controlled and taken from a list or thesaurus. The Wellcome list of role terms is created in-house based on the LC relator term list \(see Appendix C\). If no appropriate terms are listed use another concise term to indicate the nature of the relationship.

#### vii. Multiple creators

If multiple entities were involved in creating the object, or group of objects in the case of photo albums or collection level descriptions, record all of them in the manner above. If there are too numerous, record the most important or most prominent. This includes both individuals and organisations involved in the commission, production, copying, alteration and/or publication.

#### viii. Biographical details

CCO ideal: in-house name authority list. CCO would also record Nationality.
