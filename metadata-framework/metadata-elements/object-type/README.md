# Object Type

## Definition

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. 

**Object Type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique will be recorded in a separate field.

## Terminology

Object Type is recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistent terminology in the catalogue.  Common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the [**Object Type List**](object-type-list.md). When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)

## Allocating multiple terms and specificity

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects, if known or applicable.

â€ŒInclude all the relevant terms for the object or group of objects being described in the catalogue record to optimise access.

For **2D graphic objects** select one of the followings terms and add additional specific terms from the Object Type list where known or appropriate:

Drawing  
Painting  
Photograph  
Print

## **Related fields**

Object type terms for 2D graphic objects maybe duplicated in the **Technique** element. This is permissible.



_**Future wish list:**   
- the cataloguing system to include a pick list of Object types.  
- the cataloguing system or search interface can identify relevant hierarchical relationships between object types, such as Print and Poster._
