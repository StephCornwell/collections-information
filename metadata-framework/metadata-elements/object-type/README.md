# Object Type

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. CCO considers it the first critical decision in the cataloguing process.

**Object type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique will be recorded in a separate field.

Object Type is recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistent terminology in the catalogue.  The most common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the [**Object Type List**](object-type-list.md). When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)

Add both broad and specific Object Type terms to a record to increase the access points. When the cataloguer is uncertain which specific terms to apply to an object include only the known broader term.

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects, if known or applicable.

_Future wish list: the cataloguing system or search interface will automatically identify relevant hierarchical relationships between object types. This would reduce the need to include both broad and narrow terms in a record._
