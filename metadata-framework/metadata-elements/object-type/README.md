# Object Type

## Definition

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. 

**Object Type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique is recorded as a separate element. 

## Terminology

Object Type is recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistent terminology in the catalogue.  Common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the [**Object Type List**](object-type-list.md). When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)

For **2D graphic objects** select one of the followings terms and add additional specific terms from the Object Type list where known or appropriate:

Drawing  
Painting  
Photograph  
Print

For **3D objects** select one of the following terms. As our collection of 3D objects is small but less homogeneous than 2D, you may instead need to select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)

Album  
Sketchbook  
Scrapbook

For born digital objects, use the following term and add additional specific terms from the Object Type list where known or appropriate:

## Allocating multiple terms and specificity

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects, if known or applicable.

â€ŒInclude all the relevant terms for the object or group of objects being described in the catalogue record to optimise access.

{% hint style="info" %}
14 drawings, 8 photographs, and 9 prints 
{% endhint %}

## **Related fields**

Object type terms for 2D graphic objects may be duplicated in the **Technique** element. 



_**Future wish list:**   
- the cataloguing system to include a pick list of Object types, rather than current free text fields. The current system setup will necessitate the use of both the Wellcome genre list and the Object type list.  
- the cataloguing system or search interface can identify relevant hierarchical relationships between object types, such as Print and Poster._
