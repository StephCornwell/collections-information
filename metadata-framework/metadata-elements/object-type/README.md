# Object Type

## Definition

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. 

**Object Type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique is recorded as a separate element. 

## Terminology

Object Type is recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistent terminology in the catalogue.  Common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the [**Object Type List**](object-type-list.md). When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) 

For born digital objects, use the broad term 'image file'.

The broadest **object type term or terms is** best expressed in conjunction with the **number of objects** data.

{% hint style="info" %}
**1 print** 

**3 paintings**

**14 drawings, 8 photographs and 9 paintings**
{% endhint %}

## Allocating multiple terms and specificity

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects, if known or applicable.

â€ŒInclude all the relevant terms for the object or group of objects being described in the catalogue record to optimise access.

{% hint style="info" %}
4 image files 

drawings and paintings
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="info" %}
1 print

poster
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="info" %}
5 photographs

glass plate negatives and sheet film 
{% endhint %}



## **Related fields**

Object type terms for 2D graphic objects may be duplicated in the **Technique** element.   
Object type is recorded in association with the **Number of Objects**



_**Future wish list:**   
- the cataloguing system to include a pick list of Object types, rather than current free text fields. The current system setup will necessitate the use of both the Wellcome genre list and the Object type list.  
- the cataloguing system or search interface can identify relevant hierarchical relationships between object types, such as Print and Poster._
