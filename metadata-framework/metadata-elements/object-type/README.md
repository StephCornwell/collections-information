# Object Type

## Definition

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. CCO considers it the first critical decision in the cataloguing process.

**Object Type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique will be recorded in a separate field.

## Terminology

Object Type is recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistent terminology in the catalogue.  The most common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the [**Object Type List**](object-type-list.md). When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)

## Allocating multiple terms

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects, if known or applicable.

Add all relevant Object Type terms to a catalogue record to increase the access points.



_**Future wish list:** the cataloguing system or search interface can identify relevant hierarchical relationships between object types._
