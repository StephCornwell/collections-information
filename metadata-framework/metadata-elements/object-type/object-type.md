# Object Type

This element identifies the specific type of object being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. CCO considers it the first critical decision in the cataloguing process.

To ensure consistent terminology the most common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the Object Type list. When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the \([https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) "Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus"\)

Add both broad and specific Object Type terms to a record to increase the access points. When unclear which specific terms to apply to an object include only the braod known term.

Ideally the cataloguing system will automatically identify relevant hierarchical relationships between object types.

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects if known.
