# Detailed Visual Description

## Definition

This element records a description of the elements, depictions, colours and representations in the visual material. 

Detailed visual description should be given for objects which would benefit from enhanced description due to their complexity, to enhance access for visually impaired audiences, or to include more detailed interpretation of the object not present elsewhere in the record. 

Detailed Visual Description can be used when cataloguing a group of objects, but is typically best used for single objects. 

## Content 

Record the subject of the image with a brief description of how and where they are situated including surrounding details and colours.

### Representation

Record if any part of the visual image represents a subject or idea that is non-abstract. Include the source of the interpretation including collaborators and cataloguers.

A White woman is depicted in a white dress and bonnet and seated in a wooden chair upholstered in red fabric. The background includes a blue wall with a window, picture frame and small table in view, and a brown carpet with a red flower pattern. Several black and brown figures pull on a rope wound around her stomach and another points an arrow into her arm. Her facial expression and body position appear to show pain.

The work is titled 'The cholic', and so it likely represents the muscular contractions and discomfort associated with Colic pain. \(Cataloguer's Interpretation\)
