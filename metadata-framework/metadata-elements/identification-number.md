# Identification Number

## Definition

This element records all identifying numbers associated with the object or group of objects.

A **unique number** must be allocated to every object or group of objects to enable identification. The number must be attached to the object or itâ€™s container.

## Current identification numbers in Wellcome Collection

Currently there is not a single sequence of identification numbers for objects in Wellcome Collection. The unique numbers follow Wellcome conventions for Visual Materials or Archives. These numbers should be recorded as the main identification number.

## Additional numbers associated with an object

The catalogue record should include all known identification numbers associated with an object or group of objects. The type of number should be recorded in addition to the number itself.

### Accession Numbers and Registration Numbers

Accession numbers and registration numbers can be identifies for an item or group of items, which can be looked up on the Transcribe Wellcome database [https://wellcome.quickbase.com/db/bqg7rhzs8](https://wellcome.quickbase.com/db/bqg7rhzs8) It is important to note that visual material has been acquired historically within the remit of both the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and Library. 

* Library accession numbers \(also used for manuscripts\) are numbers of up to 6 digits e.g. 43578, 329517
* Museum accession numbers always include the 'A' prefix e.g. A123456, A4598
* Museum registration numbers always include the 'R' prefix e.g. R56237, R98/1937 \(n.b. the prefix 'P' is used interchangably with 'R' for some paintings\)
* Museum registration numbers from the 'new' series \(those which include the year of registration as well as a running number\) are standardised to the following format: R + number + forward slash  \[/\]  + full 4-digit year e.g. R98/1937

### Visual Collections: some context

Before 1928, paintings were managed directly by the WHMM, whereas prints and drawings were the responsibility of the library. Separate catalogue and accession registers for prints survive from the early 1900s, with the first numbering sequence introduced in 1914. A distinction in documentation practice for paintings survived the merging of responsibility for prints, drawings, paintings and photographs into a single WHMM department in 1928: paintings destined for display continued to be entered into the museum registration systems \(often distinguished from other museum objects by a 'P' prefix in the sequence rather than the usual 'R'\), but unlike other museum objects do not appear to have been allocated 'A' numbers. Instead, separate accession registers and card indexes were maintained for prints, engravings, drawings, paintings and photographs, distinct from the main museum registers and card indexes. Collections of prints, drawings, paintings and photographs reverted to the responsibility of the library from 1974, although new acquisitions to these collections continued to be documented in the various specialist registers until the 1980s, and only thereafter in the main library registers.
