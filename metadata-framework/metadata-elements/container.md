# Container

## Definition

This element records the original container an object, or group of objects, is stored in **if kept for production with the object**.

## What is a container?

A container includes any structured form that houses an object but is not integral to it.

Main known containers in the collection include:

* Box
* Frame
* Mount

If the container is to be recorded and produced separately, the container element should not be used. 

## Layout

The container element is best displayed alongside the [number of objects](number-of-objects.md) and [object ](object-type/)type.

Multiple containers may be included in natural language order

{% hint style="info" %}
3 paintings mounted in frame

4 photographs in box 
{% endhint %}



Additional information written on the original container, the condition and/or the physical characteristics of the container, can be included in a descriptive or provenance note to enhance the record.

## Related Elements 

The dimensions of a container, if relevant, may be recorded as part of the [dimensions](dimensions.md) element.

Container is recorded in association with **Object type** and the **Number of Objects.**
