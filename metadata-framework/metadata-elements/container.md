# Container

## Definition

This element records the original container an object, or group of objects, is stored in if kept for production.

## What is a container?

A container includes any structured form that houses visual material, including boxes, frames, mounts and books.

Known containers in the collection include:

* Album
* Box
* Frame
* Mount
* Scrapbook
* Sketchbook

## Layout

The container element is best displayed alongside the [number of objects](number-of-objects.md) and [object ](object-type/)type.

Multiple containers may be included in natural language order

{% hint style="info" %}
4 photographs mounted in 1 frame
{% endhint %}

The dimensions of a container, if relevant, may be recorded as part of the [dimensions](dimensions.md) element.

## Related Elements 

If cataloguing a grouping of material, the container may instead be understood as the [object type](object-type/).
