# Current Location

## Definition 

The permanent location of an object or group of objects. 

## Identifier

This should be a standardised system for recording the exact location of an object within a store. At 215 Euston Road, this may take the form of an alphanumeric string to record the store, bay and shelf number, or simply the box number within a collection. For offsite materials, it refers to the identifying barcode number. 

This should not be made visible to the public for security reasons. 

## General Location

To increase the interoperability of the record and for transparency, all records should state where they are currently held; the majority of our collection will be held by Wellcome Collection.
