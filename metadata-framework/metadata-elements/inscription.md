# Inscription / Marks

## Definition

The inscription element offers a transcription \(and where necessary a description\) of any distinguishing or identifying physical lettering, annotations, texts, markings, or labels that are affixed, applied, stamped, written, inscribed, or attached to the work. It excludes any mark or text inherent in the materials of which the work is made.

## Capturing an inscription

Among the various types of inscriptions, it is a priority to record signatures, dates, and inscribed titles.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Single Object" %}
Transcribe the inscription exactly as it appears on the object, replicating the spelling, diacritics, case and abbreviations used in the inscription. Indicate line breaks with a forward slash.

Follow each discrete part of the inscription with an explanation of the inscription type and location on the object.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

Where the object has been signed by hand record this information. 

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Groups of Objects" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Capturing stamps and ownership marks

Where a stamp or mark can be transcribed, include a transcription, followed by a brief explanation of the mark type.

If the mark can not easily be transcribed, include a brief description of the mark type.

If the mark can be attributed to a particular person or identifiable body then include this information.

{% endhint %}

## Exhaustivity

If an inscription is too long to transcribe, transcribe part of it and indicate missing text with an ellipsis.

{% hint style="info" %}

## Ambiguity and uncertainty
