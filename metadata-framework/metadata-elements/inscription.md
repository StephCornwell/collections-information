# Inscription / Marks

## Definition

The inscription element offers a transcription \(and where necessary a description\) of any distinguishing or identifying physical lettering, annotations, texts, markings, or labels that are affixed, applied, stamped, written, inscribed, or attached to the work. It excludes any mark or text inherent in the materials of which the work is made.

## Capturing an inscription

Among the various types of inscriptions, it is a priority to record signatures, dates, and inscribed titles. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Single Object" %}
Transcribe the inscription exactly as it appears on the object, replicating the spelling, diacritics, case and abbreviations used in the inscription. Indicate line breaks with a forward slash. 

Follow each discrete part of the inscription with an explanation of the inscription type and location on the object. 



Inscribed titles must be entered into the title element of the record
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Groups of Objects" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
'Etched by George Cruikshank' \(signature, printed, bottom left recto\) 

'Artificial Pigeon Shooting, at the Stadium, Chelsea.' \(printed, bottom centre recto\)
{% endhint %}

## Exhaustivity

If an inscription is too long to transcribe, transcribe part of it and indicate missing text with an ellipsis.

## Ambiguity and uncertainty

For any words or characters that are not clear, include these within square brackets to indicate uncertainty.
