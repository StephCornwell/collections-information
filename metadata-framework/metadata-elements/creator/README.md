# Creator

## Definition

The Creator element should capture the name\(s\) of those responsible for the design and making of an object, and their role in that process. The metadata should record all identified creators.

Creators can be individuals, groups of individuals, corporate bodies or other entities involved in the creation of an object.

### i. Identifying creators

The names of creators should be taken from the object itself or accompanying documentation from acquisition, previous cataloguing or provenance records. Where the creator name is taken from another source ensure that information is noted in the record and include a reference to the source.

### ii. Unknown creators

Where a creator is not known the creator element can be omitted. If the geographical origin is known this can be used in the description to provide background to an unknown creator, e.g. Italian

### iii. Ambiguous creators

If attribution is uncertain or ambiguous record this information in the record.

{% hint style="info" %}
attributed to Raphael

probably by F. Vizetelly
{% endhint %}

If opinion on attribution is divided, then record this information in the record and index all the names in question.

{% hint style="info" %}
possibly by Denis Gascoigne Lillie or T. Jeffery Parker.
{% endhint %}

### iv. Name

The format and spelling for creator names should be taken from an authority list to ensure consistency. Check for an entry in the **Wellcome Collection catalogue** and use this if present. If the name is new to the Wellcome catalogue, check: [**LC Library of Congress authorities**](https://authorities.loc.gov/), [**ULAN: Getty Union List of Artists Names**](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/) or other reliable sources.

**Personal names**  
If there is more than one version of the name in use, select the most commonly used.

Personal names should be structured as follows, include the known or relevant elements:

Surname, First name\(s\), Title, dates of existence, role in relation to the object \(optional\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Lichtenstein, Roy, 1923-1997, painter

Thompson, J. \(John\), 1837-1921, photographer

Hogarth, William, 1697-1764
{% endhint %}

When an artist is recognised by a single name, prefer the known name over Surname, First name structure.

{% hint style="info" %}
Raphael, 1493-1520
{% endhint %}

**Corporate names**  
If no authority can be found, take the name as it is written on the object or accompanying documentation. Where there is more than version of the name in use prefer the version found in the LC or ULAN authority lists.

### v. Dates

For personal names include dates if known.

Where the birth and death dates are not known, include the full range of dates for the artworks you are aware of, as an approximate active date.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bell, Stuart, active 1966-68
{% endhint %}

For corporate names, dates are only applied to names in relation to meeting or conference dates.

### vi. Role of creator

In addition to the creator name, record the relationship of that person/entity to the object, i.e. their role in its creation. To ensure consistency, terminology should be taken from the Wellcome [**Relator Terms list**](relator-terms.md). If no appropriate terms are listed use another concise term to indicate the nature of the relationship.

### vii. Multiple creators

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Individual Object" %}
If multiple entities were involved in creating the object record all of them in the manner above. If they are too numerous, record the most important or most prominent. This includes both individuals and organisations involved in the commission, production, copying, alteration and/or publication.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of Objects" %}
If multiple entities were involved in creating the group of objects \(such as photo albums\), record all of them in the manner above. If they are too numerous, record the most important or most prominent. This includes both individuals and organisations involved in the commission, production, copying, alteration and/or publication.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### viii. Biographical details

Include biographical information on the creator when such information is not common knowledge and where the objects are unique or significant to Wellcome Collection.

_Future Wish List:_  
_CCO ideal: in-house name authority list.  
CCO would record Nationality._
