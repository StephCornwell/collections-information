# Title/Brief Description

## Definition

The title or name given to an object, or a brief description of the object. This element is essential, even when an object has no given title and can only be given a name or a brief description. It offers a name by which to refer to the object and aids identification. 

## Types of Title

### Title given by creator



### Inscribed title / caption title



### Brief descriptive title



## Alternative Titles

Previous title, replaced DATE \(Month Year\): Text of previous title

Previous title, replaced November 2019: The face of a beautiful woman is revealed as a mask covering her real face, which is hideously disfigured with syphilitic sores. Colour lithograph after Forsyth, ca. 1946\(?\)
