# Title/Brief Description

## Definition

The title or name given to an object, or a brief description of the object. This element is essential, even when an object has no given title and can only be given a brief description. It offers a name by which to refer to the object and aids identification. 

## Types of Title 

### Given Title

This is a title of an object, or a collective title for a group of objects, assigned by the creator or another authoritative source.

{% hint style="info" %}
Nail schizophrene.  [3049675i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/azc3hheb)
{% endhint %}



### Inscribed Title

This is a title taken from an inscription \(lettering\) on the object or group of objects.

{% hint style="info" %}
No smoking no hate.  [3197871i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/trkdjmg3)
{% endhint %}

### 

### Descriptive Title

With a descriptive title a brief description of the object or group of objects is provided which can be used for identification purposes. 

For 2D and Born Digital graphic objects this should be a short description of the subject matter of the item. Include, as appropriate, the following types of information:

* the subject type or form of material, e.g., view\(s\), portrait\(s\), sketch\(es\)
* an identification of the main subject\(s\) depicted \(i.e., names of persons, events, activities, and objects\)
* geographical location\(s\) depicted, if known and significant
* the date or span dates of what is being depicted if different from the date of publication or execution

For 3D objects

## Title Source

Record the source of the preferred \(main\) title used in the catalogue record. Record if the title was provided by the creator, has been taken from the object itself, from previous owners, from supporting documentation, or whether the title is a brief description of the work created by the cataloguer. Where possible select the appropriate text from the list below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Single Object" %}
* Title provided by the artist.
* Title provided by the creator.
* The title has been taken from lettering on the object. 
* This work is untitled: the title has been supplied by the cataloguer for identification purposes.
* This work is untitled: the title has been taken from acquisition documentation.
* Title taken from published source: \[example: Catalogue of prints & drawings in the British Museum\].
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of Objects" %}
* Title provided by the artist.
* Title provided by the creator.
* These works are untitled: the title has been taken from lettering on the objects. 
* These works are untitled: the title has been supplied by the cataloguer for identification purposes.
* These works are untitled: the title has been taken from acquisition documentation.
* Title taken from published source: \[example: Catalogue of prints & drawings in the British Museum\].
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Born Digital Objects" %}
* Title provided by the artist.
* Title provided by the creator.
* To enhance accessibility, the title has been supplied by the cataloguer. 
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Preferred and Alternative Titles

Record the title by which the object is known by at the owning institution as the preferred \(main\) title.

Where the preferred title is a Given title or Inscribed title, ensure a brief description of the object is also included in the record.

Record all other known titles or names that have been associated with an object. 

## Amending the Preferred Title

If a new title needs to be given where an existing cataloguer title is incorrect, insufficient or offensive, include the existing title as an alternative title in the the following layout:

Previous title, replaced DATE \(Month Year\): Text of previous title

{% hint style="info" %}
Previous title, replaced November 2019: The face of a beautiful woman is revealed as a mask covering her real face, which is hideously disfigured with syphilitic sores. Colour lithograph after Forsyth, ca. 1946\(?\)
{% endhint %}

## The use of Untitled as a title

When a creator assigns Untitled as the title of an object, this should be used as the preferred title in the record.

Untitled should not be used as a title when an object has no given title.

{% hint style="info" %}
Untitled. [3272401i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/rnsgfs2m)
