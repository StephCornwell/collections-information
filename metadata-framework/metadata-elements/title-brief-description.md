## Amending the Preferred Title

If a new title needs to be given where an existing cataloguer title is incorrect, insufficient or offensive, include the existing title as an alternative title in the the following layout:

Previous title, replaced DATE \(Month Year\): Text of previous title

{% hint style="info" %}
Previous title, replaced November 2019: The face of a beautiful woman is revealed as a mask covering her real face, which is hideously disfigured with syphilitic sores. Colour lithograph after Forsyth, ca. 1946\(?\)
{% endhint %}

## The use of Untitled as a title

When a creator assigns Untitled as the title of an object, this should be used as the preferred title in the record.

Untitled should not be used as a title when an object has no given title.
