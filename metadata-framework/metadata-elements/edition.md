# Edition

## **Definition**

For prints and 2D and 3D objects produced in multiples, the term edition is used to:

* place a specific object in the context of multiples of the same object issued at the same time. In this situation it would describe prints created from the same matrix \(plate\) or sculptures cast from the same mold. 

_or_

* to place that object in relation to previous and subsequent editions.

## Source

Edition statements may be found on the title page or within book-like works, or in inscriptions on single-sheet works. Secondary sources, such as catalogues raisonnés, can help to identify the edition of a work, as will comparison to other known instances of the same work.

## Style and Language

* Use Arabic cardinal numbers \(e.g. 5\) and ordinal numbers \(e.g. 3rd\) as appropriate.

{% hint style="info" %}
3rd edition
{% endhint %}

* For objects issued in multiples at the same time, record the edition information as a fractional number: the impression number/edition size

{% hint style="info" %}
3/50
{% endhint %}

* Avoid abbreviations.
* Use lower case except when a term includes a proper name.

{% hint style="info" %}
Victoria edition
{% endhint %}

* If there is an edition statement on the work, transcribe it in the original language.

{% hint style="info" %}
Édition Müller
{% endhint %}
