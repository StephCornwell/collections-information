# Edition

## **Definition**

For prints and 2D and 3D objects produced in multiples, the term edition is used to:

* place a specific object in the context of multiples of the same object issued at the same time. In the case of prints the multiples are created from the same matrix. 

_or_

* to place that object in relation to previous and subsequent editions.

## Style and Language

Use Arabic cardinal numbers \(e.g. 5\) and ordinal numbers \(e.g. 3rd\) as appropriate.

Avoid abbreviations.

Use lower case except when a term includes a proper name.

If there is an edition statement on the work, transcribe it in the original language.
