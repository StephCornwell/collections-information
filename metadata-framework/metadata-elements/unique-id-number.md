# Unique ID Number

## Definition

This element records all identifying numbers associated with the object or group of objects.

A **unique number** must be allocated to every object to enable identification of an object or group of objects. The number must be attached to the object or itâ€™s container.

The catalogue should record all previous numbers associated with the object or group of objects.

## Current Identification Numbers in Wellcome Collection

## Additional Numbers associated with an object

The catalogue should include all known previous identification numbers associated with an object. The type of the number should be recorded in addition to the number.
