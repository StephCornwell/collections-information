# Date

## Definition

The Date element records the date of creation, production or publication of the object. For unpublished works the date will refer to a date of creation. For published objects such as prints there may be a publication date and/or a copyright date.

### i. Types of Date

Only the creation date is mandatory; if not known, it can be estimated.

**Creation Date**   
Record the date the object was created or produced as standardised below.

**Publication Date**  
If applicable and known, record the date the object was published.

**Copyright Date**  
If applicable and known, record the object’s copyright date.

**Acquisition Date**  
If applicable and known, record the object’s acquisition date.



**Other Dates**  
For some objects there can be multiple creation dates relating to different aspects of the process, or a date range to capture a period of creation. Where necessary include a note to explain the dates given to the object. Any other known dates associated with the alteration of the object, or if the object is a copy of another, should be added to a note or description field in the record.

If date on an object is ambiguous \(unclear day, month, year order\), if taken from another source or the date is estimated, a note should also be included in the record using standardised text below.

For year ranges, if possible record the Earliest and Latest dates.
