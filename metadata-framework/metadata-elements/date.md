# Date

## Definition

The Date element records the date of creation, production or publication of the object. For unpublished works the date will refer to a date of creation. For published objects such as prints there may be a publication date and/or a copyright date.

i. Types of Date
Only the creation date is mandatory; if not known, it can be estimated.

Creation Date 
Record the date the object was created or produced as standardised below.

Publication Date 
If applicable and known, record the date the object was published.

Copyright Date
If applicable and known, record the object’s copyright date.  

Other Dates
For some objects there can be multiple creation dates relating to different aspects of the process, or a date range to capture a period of creation. Where necessary include a note to explain the dates given to the object.
Any other known dates associated with the alteration of the object, or if the object is a copy of another, should be added to a note or description field in the record. 
e.g	photograph taken 1898, printed 1914
