# Metadata Elements

## Scope

The metadata framework identifies relevant metadata categories \(elements\) for cataloguing an object from the Visual and Material Culture collection. The identified elements aim to ensure catalogue records contain common metadata content regardless of the system used for cataloguing.

The framework reflects the approach of [Cataloguing Cultural Objects CCO](https://vraweb.org/resources/cataloging-cultural-objects/) with additional practices taken from [Categories for the Description of Works of Art CDWA](http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/).

It is recognised it may not be possible to provide content for each category, but the cataloguer should aim to populate as many as available information allows.

The framework is designed as a reference on which to build cataloguing instructions for specific databases and systems.
