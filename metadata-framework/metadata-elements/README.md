# Metadata Elements

The Metadata Framework identifies relevant metadata categories \(elements\) for cataloguing an object from the Visual and Material Culture collection. The identified elements aim to ensure catalogue records contain common metadata content regardless of the system used for cataloguing.

The framework reflects the approach of [Cataloguing Cultural Objects CCO](https://vraweb.org/resources/cataloging-cultural-objects/) with practices taken from [Categories for the Description of Works of Art CDWA](http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/) and[ DCRM\(G\)](https://rbms.info/files/dcrm/dcrmg/DCRMG-A4.pdf).

It is recognised it may not be possible to provide content for each category, but the cataloguer should aim to populate as many as available information allows.

The cataloguer may also have instances where there is additional relevant information about the object that does not fit the elements outlined in the Metadata Framework - in such cases include the information in a note field, or other suitable field for the system being used to catalogue.

The framework is designed as a reference on which to build cataloguing instructions for specific databases and systems.
