# Metadata Crosswalk

## [http://vraweb.org/resources/cataloging-metadata-and-data-management/crosswalks-mapping-and-database-design/](http://vraweb.org/resources/cataloging-metadata-and-data-management/crosswalks-mapping-and-database-design/)

## Shortcomings

Would like audit trail built into system which records changes made to records and by whom. 



### Authority Terminology 

Currently using local terms because neither system we use is currently adequately set up to manage authorities. Getty AAT for example is intended to be used in a hierarchical manner and removing the terms from their wider context, means we have to enter more terms to create more access points. 

See this appraisal of the AAT for further discussion of its shortcomings as an authority: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275144819\_The\_Art\_and\_Architecture\_Thesaurus\_AAT\_A\_Critical\_Appraisal](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275144819_The_Art_and_Architecture_Thesaurus_AAT_A_Critical_Appraisal)

### Other recommendations
