# Content considerations

Metadata created for the Collections must apply the principles outlined in the Collection Information Policy: diverse and inclusive, and consistent and coherent in the language used.

## Sources of Information

The chief source of information is any text provided by the creator on or with the item being catalogued. [DCRM\(G\)](https://rbms.info/files/dcrm/dcrmg/DCRMG-A4.pdf)

If further information is available, beyond that provided by the creator or the item, then this should be included in the record and the source acknowledged where appropriate.

When describing material known to be imperfect \(physically damaged or lacking information available on a complete example\), the catalogue record should describe a perfect example, if that information is available. Cite the source used for the perfect item and include a local note on the imperfection DCRM\(G\) 0B2.2. 

## Sensitivity

Consider the context in which the item was produced, and any personal data to be included in the bibliographic record - was the item produced in a context that would warrant sensitivity considerations, such as a therapy session? Consult [Access to personal data within our research collections](http://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/access-to-personal-data.pdf) to identify material that should be considered for restricted access or personal data that should not be made public.

## Language

When including any information as free text ie. not controlled terminology, think about the language being used and how the information is framed. The [APA bias-free language guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) is helpful to think about this process.

[Words Matter](https://www.tropenmuseum.nl/en/about-tropenmuseum/words-matter-publication) - complied by the Troppen Museum, contains a glossary which contextualises historical terms commonly used in museum collections.

The National Library of Scotland have been working on a glossary of terms - link when available
