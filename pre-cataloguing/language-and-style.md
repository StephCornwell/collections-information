# Language & Style

## Language

When including any information as free text ie. not controlled terminology, think about the language being used and how the information is framed. The [APA bias-free language guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) is helpful to think about this process.

Other links \(perhaps link to wider resource around how we catalogue inclusively\)

[Words Matter](https://www.tropenmuseum.nl/en/about-tropenmuseum/words-matter-publication) - complied by the Troppen Museum, contains a glossary which contextualises historical terms commonly used in museum collections.

The National Library of Scotland have been working on a glossary of terms - link when available
