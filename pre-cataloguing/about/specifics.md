# Identifying photographs

## Process

### Object View

Looking at the object without magnification or additional lighting. Helpful to narrow down potential date ranges. 

#### Subject

Look at clues in the subject of the photograph. What are the people wearing? How is their hair styled? Are there vehicles in shot? Any buildings? These can all be good indicators of placing a photograph after a specific time period. 

#### Format

The format of the photograph can also indicate an earliest possible time period ie. a Carte de visite could be dated earlier than a postcard. 

#### Information written or printed on the object

Stamps, dates, inscriptions and lettering can again help narrow down the possible dates of the techniques. Sometimes they even state the technique outright!

#### Support

Whilst paper is the most common support, certain supports can indicate a specific technique is more likely. For example glass supports are more likely to be wet plate collodion and gelatin dry plate process and metal supports are most likely to be daguerreotypes or tintypes. 

#### Colour and tone

The chemicals used in the process as well as the stability of the compounds over time will affect the colour of the photograph. This[ chart](http://www.graphicsatlas.org/media/pdfs/image_color.pdf) better helps understand the visual difference in colour and tone and [this](http://www.graphicsatlas.org/media/pdfs/image_deterioration.pdf) for specific image deterioration that might indicate specific techniques. 

#### Surface

How does the print reflect or not reflect light. [This ](http://www.graphicsatlas.org/media/pdfs/surface_sheen.pdf)chart helps identify whether it is matte, glossy or somewhere in-between. 

### Web Resources

[Graphics Atlas](http://www.graphicsatlas.org/)

Includes an identification tool and general advice on how to identify techniques and processes for photographs and photographic prints including timelines. The process advice above has also been developed from this resource but omits the advanced magnification stage. 

There are also short summary videos and longer webinars available through [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ImagePermanenceInstitute/videos) and a website dedicated to [digital prints](http://www.dp3project.org/identification).
