# Visual and Material Culture Inventory Metadata

**Visual and Material Culture Inventory**

The inventory of the Visual and Material Culture Collections is an audit of catalogued material and an inventory of uncatalogued material in line with the Spectrum 5.0 Inventory standard and Museum Accreditation.

For catalogued material we have exported data from our catalogue \(Sierra – Library Management System\) and for uncatalogued material we are creating data for the first time to understand what is held in our collections. Both catalogued and uncatalogued material is being inventoried using a database called QuickBase.

For catalogued material we have exported data from our catalogue \(Sierra – Library Management System\) and for uncatalogued material we are creating data for the first time to understand what is held in our collections. Both catalogued and uncatalogued material is being inventoried using a database called QuickBase.

Some of the data we input or select within QuickBase, is from a controlled list of terms and can be selected from a drop-down list. Controlled terms have been agreed to keep data consistent and to support inventory and wider colleagues with how to approach a wide range of inventory encounters. For example, controlled terms for the item condition has been agreed with colleagues in Collections Care, in line with condition ratings and terms they use, with a shared understanding of which rating to apply \(Good, Fair, Poor, Unacceptable\). A controlled list has also been agreed for damage type, i.e. tears, stains, dirt, folded/creased, high risk of loss etc.

Some of the data we input or select, is from a controlled list of terms and in our database can be selected from a drop-down list. These controlled terms have been agreed to keep data input consistent and to support inventory and wider colleagues to respond to a wide range of inventory encounters. Controlled terms have been agreed for: Object name, Condition, Condition damage type and for part numbering to ensure in various scenarios items can be assigned unique numbers whilst retaining relationships with other material and collections. Damage type terms have been agreed with colleagues in Collections Care to ensure data is consistent with their processes and understanding of what is meant by condition ratings good, fair, poor and unacceptable.

\*For subject classifications – we have imported existing lists into our database that cross reference to labels on containers in stores, to retain groupings and record historical cataloguing and collections management conventions.

\*\* - The author fields here refer to creators, but for inventory purposes we have aligned headings with MARC as this is how the data has been organised/referred to in our existing catalogue.

Terms in bold italics - These are mandatory data requirements from the Spectrum Inventory Standard.

### Assigning temporary numbers

Any item or group of items processed during inventory that are uncatalogued, will be assigned a temporary number in the format 'INV/YEAR/SEQUENTIAL NUMBER'. This number will never be applied to the item directly, but can be found on the housing, folder, or container the item or groups of items are stored in. These numbers will always be written in pencil, and can be used to identify material for cataloguing.

### Please note that an inventory number can apply to one item or a group of items.
